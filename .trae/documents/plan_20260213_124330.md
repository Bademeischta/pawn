I will fix the `start.ps1` script by removing the custom function definitions and replacing all occurrences of `Write-Info`, `Write-Success`, `Write-Warn`, and `Write-ErrorMsg` with standard `Write-Host` commands with the appropriate colors. This ensures maximum compatibility and prevents the "CommandNotFoundException" you encountered.

**Steps:**

1. **Rewrite** **`c:\pawn\start.ps1`**:

   * Remove `function Write-Info ...`, `function Write-Success ...`, etc.

   * Replace `Write-Info "Msg"` -> `Write-Host "ℹ Msg" -ForegroundColor Cyan`

   * Replace `Write-Success "Msg"` -> `Write-Host "✔ Msg" -ForegroundColor Green`

   * Replace `Write-Warn "Msg"` -> `Write-Host "⚠ Msg" -ForegroundColor Yellow`

   * Replace `Write-ErrorMsg "Msg"` -> `Write-Host "✖ Msg" -ForegroundColor Red`
