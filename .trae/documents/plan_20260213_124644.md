I will completely rewrite `start.ps1` to address the syntax errors and simplify the logic as requested.

**Changes:**
1.  **Simplified Python Version Check:** Replace the regex `(8|9|10|11|12)` with a simple string match `-match "Python 3"`.
2.  **Robust Syntax:** Ensure all `try` blocks have corresponding `catch` blocks and that all braces `{ }` are correctly paired.
3.  **Standard Output:** Use only `Write-Host -ForegroundColor ...` (no custom functions).
4.  **Process Handling:** Use `Get-Command` to safely check for Python and pipes for version string capture to avoid "pipeline" errors.

I will then write this clean, syntax-verified code to `c:\pawn\start.ps1`.
